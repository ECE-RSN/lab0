# lab0
Welcome to Robotics Sensing and Navigation! 
These GitHub repositories will serve as the primary place for lab assignment handouts, although we may also post some materials on Piazza.

At the start of each lab, you should clone each repository to get the files. 
You can also read the instructions here. 

The lab instructions and tutorial files are written as Jupyter notebooks. If you need to install Jupyter to your computer, instructions are here: https://jupyter.org/install
If you clone the lab repo and use the files locally, you should definitely install Jupyter.
